**Patient Classification Based on Blood Report:**

**Overview:**
This project involves classifying patients into incare and outcare based on their blood report data. The classification is performed using a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing blood report features.

**Project Structure:**
patient_classification.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
dataset.csv: Dataset containing the blood report data used for training and testing the machine learning model.

**Getting Started:**
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:>
git clone https://github.com/smitzo/patient_treatment_classification.git>

Run the Notebook: Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.>

**Dependencies:**
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python packages are listed in the requirements.txt file.
**
Models Used:**
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
