**Patient Classification Based on Blood Report:**

**Overview:**
This project involves classifying patients into incare and outcare based on their blood report data. The classification is performed using a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing blood report features.

**Project Structure:**
patient_classification.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
dataset.csv: Dataset containing the blood report data used for training and testing the machine learning model.

**Getting Started:**
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/smitzo/patient_treatment_classification.git
Open the Notebook: Open the patient_classification.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Run the Notebook: Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.
Explore the Dataset: Take a look at the dataset.csv file to understand the structure of the data and the features available.

**Dependencies:**
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python packages are listed in the requirements.txt file.
